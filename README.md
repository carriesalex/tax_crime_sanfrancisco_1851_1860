Taxes and Crime in San Francisco, 1851-1860

This is the data and analysis for taxes and
crime in San Francisco from 1851 to 1860. All of the data was pulled from
reports and tables published in newspapers of the period. Some are
available online, some were only accessible or legible in bound newspapers
at the California State Library. This data and analysis supports my conclusions
in my Ph.D. dissertation in History, completed in May of 2021, at the 
University of California, Davis, entitled,
"Buying Time: Negotiating Boundaries of Delay in Property, Taxation, 
and Crime, 1850-1860."
